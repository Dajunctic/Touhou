Somewhere deep inside the forest...
??????
Did you hear the news? Looks like we're about to have a horrible-sounding blood sacrifice ever!
######
I just heard about it too, our lord have found the ancient magic circle to connect this world with hell.
??????
Hell!...
######
Right! Are you feeling your own blood boiling?
??????
So it's a sign...

Hahaha hahaha! So is our time coming? Damn onmyouji, when we get our power back from hell we won't have to run around like this anymore.

The creepy laughter resounded in a corner of the forest in the middle of the night, causing a commotion around the surroundings.

The crows also suddenly squawked with horror...

Light is the core thing that gives birth to all things, from single-celled bodies to evolve into multi-cells and then into creatures like our world.

However, according to an ancient note, there existed a world covered by a long, seemingly endless night that swallowed all that existed in it.
noone
Strange things happen that we can't explain, can't even imagine, maybe it's a miracle.

In the deep and cold darkness, mutant forms thrive and evolve constantly...

Looks like tonight is going to be another peaceful night! Suddenly, a call came out of nowhere.
Someone
Hakurei! Hakurei!
Hakurei
Alice!
Hakurei
You look rushed!
Alice
Phew phew, we are getting some troubles.
Alice
There was a prophetic talisman that was burned, when I entered the temple it was already ashes.
Alice
Perhaps recently some dark power has appeared, and this power seems to be terrible.
Alice
We need to investigate this matter urgently.

Alice lit a talisman and chanted some magical spells, the small lights lit up and seemed to be leading the two girls somewhere.
noone
The two followed the small lights that led the way.

Kaka, why are these two cute girls hanging around here.
Alice
Be careful, Hakurei!
Hakurei
I'm always in battle mode. Ready to fight!!!
